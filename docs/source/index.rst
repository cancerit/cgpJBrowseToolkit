Contains various scripts and tools that work with or on `JBrowse <http://jbrowse.org/>`_ that are publicly useful.

********************
jbrowse_rasterize.js
********************

Generate screenshots from your JBrowse instance using the URL and a BED file of locations of interest.

Requires a working installation of `casperjs <http://casperjs.org/>`_.

The advantages of this over looping on the standard phantomjs rasterize.js are:

* Cache of data is maintained.
* Also works with sites secured with http_basic:

  * Password in text file - **Set permissions accordingly**.
  * Sites not requiring auth load silently.
  * If not provided when required you will see an error like: ``[warning] [phantom] Loading resource failed with status=fail (HTTP 401): ...``.

* Trims images back to correct height (except pdf).
* Attempts to automatically compensate for track loading times based on requested base URL.
* Hides tracklist automatically.

Usage is simple, set up the display with relevant tracks in the browser and provide the updated URL it to the script::

  $ casperjs jbrowse_rasterize.js \
  --width=1200 \
  --imgType=png \
  --locs=places.bed \
  --outdir=wibble1 \
  --baseUrl='http://localhost:8999/JBrowse/?data=auto%2F1404&loc=1%3A115102801..115404000&tracks=...'

baseUrl    Yes       URL               JBrowse URL to base all snapshots on.
navOff     No        N/A               Presence causes the navigation panel to be excluded
                                       from image.

Tested track types
------------------
All testing carried out under JBrowse 1.12.3 rc1.

Functionality of the following tracks has been tested:

* Alignments2
* VCF
* XYplot
* CanvasFeatures
* Sequence

Known issues
------------
At present doesn't process the `multibigwig <https://github.com/elsiklab/multibigwig>`_ plugin track correctly.
The ``loading`` divs clear when the canvas is added but even with extended timeout (far more than time taken in browser)
I can't get the multiple layers of the canvas to render, only the scale.

Please report issues with other track types if found.
