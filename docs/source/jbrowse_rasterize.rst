jbrowse_rasterize.js
====================

Generate screenshots from your JBrowse instance using the URL and a BED file of locations of interest.

************
Requirements
************

Requires a working installation of `casperjs <http://casperjs.org/>`_ and `phantomjs <http://phantomjs.org/>`_.

************************************
Benefits over phantomjs rasterize.js
************************************

The advantages of this over looping on the standard phantomjs rasterize.js are:

* Cache of data is maintained.
* Also works with sites secured with http_basic (see :ref:`http-basic-authentication`).
* Trims images back to correct height (except pdf).
* Attempts to automatically compensate for track loading times based on requested base URL.
* Hides tracklist automatically.

*****
Usage
*****

*All arguments require* ``--`` *prefix.*

Usage is simple, set up the display with relevant tracks in the browser and provide the updated URL it to the script::

  $ jbrowse_rasterize.js \
  --width=1200 \
  --imgType=png \
  --locs=places.bed \
  --outdir=wibble1 \
  --baseUrl='http://localhost:8999/JBrowse/?data=auto%2F1404&loc=1%3A115102801..115404000&tracks=...'

.. _http-basic-authentication:

HTTP-BASIC authentication
-------------------------
To use this with a site secured with http_basic you need to provide your password for the
authentication phase.  To do this under casperjs it's being read from a file (if you know
of a better way please get in touch).


Please **set permissions accordingly**, don't expose your password on a network drive.

Other:

* Sites not requiring auth load silently.
* If not provided when required you will see an error like: ``[warning] [phantom] Loading resource failed with status=fail (HTTP 401): ...``.

Tested track types
------------------
All testing carried out under JBrowse 1.12.3 rc1.

Functionality of the following tracks has been tested:

* Alignments2
* VCF
* XYplot
* CanvasFeatures
* Sequence

Known issues
------------
* `multibigwig <https://github.com/elsiklab/multibigwig>`_ - plugin track will only render with v0.7.0+

Please report any problems with other track types on the `GitHub issue tracker <https://github.com/cancerit/cgpJBrowseToolkit/issues>`_
