How jbrowse_rasterize works
===========================

``jbrowse_rasterize`` now uses `Puppeteer <https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer>`_ which allows
testing for network activity to cease before indicating a page has completed rendering.

There is no longer a guess as to how long it will take for elements to have completed drawing as

The ability to take screenshots in JBrowse is made diffcult by there being no true end-point to the
generation of a view.  All actions are asynchronous with no single testable variable or element.

``jbrowse_rasterize`` attempted to compensate for this by testing several critical elements of the DOM::

  document.readyState === "complete" &&
  document.getElementsByClassName('innerTrackContainer')[0].getElementsByClassName('track').length === trackCount+1 &&
  document.getElementsByClassName('loading').length === 0

``trackCount`` needs ``+1`` to account for the grid background track.
